This is a training program for the LIMBS lab dome project, meant to be run on the Raspberry Pi B+ model with an Adafruit 16x2 RGB LCD Pi Plate.

On a fresh Raspbian install, the following steps will be necessary to configure the Pi:

> sudo raspi-config 
In this menu, choose 'Advanced Options', then 'I2C', and answer yes to both questions.  Now restart the device.

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-symbus python-pip i2c-tools
> sudo pip install RPi.GPIO

> sudo nano /etc/modules
Add the following lines to the end of the file:

i2c-bcm2708
i2c-dev

> sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf
If the following lines exist, comment them out:

blacklist spi-bcm2708
blacklist i2c-bcm2708

> sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Add the following lines to the end of the file:

device_tree=bcm2708-rpi-b-plus.dtb
device_tree_param=i2c1=on
device_tree_param=spi=on

Finally, in the directory of the repository, run:
> sudo python setup.py install
to install Adafruit's LCD library.

Now reboot, and the installation should be completed.
